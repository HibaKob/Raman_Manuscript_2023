# Raman_Manuscript_2023

## Introduction 
This repository contains the code used to quantify the mechanical behavior of optically stimulated muscle sheets as described in the manuscript "Magnetic Hydrogel Actuators as Mechanically Active Cell Culture Substrates" by Brandon Rios, Angel Bu, Tara Sheehan, Hiba Kobeissi, 
Emma Lejeune, and Ritu Raman (link forthcoming). 

## Code description
The ``code`` folder in this repository contains $4$ python files: ``prepare_files.py``, ``run_code.py``, ``image_analysis.py``, and ``strain_analysis.py``. 

The ``prepare_files.py`` file contains the script required to perform the necessary video pre-processing steps. 

## Running the code
